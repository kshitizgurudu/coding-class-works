    <h2>Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4 Verse 9</h2>
    <p>This is a verse from Bhagavad Gita, describing the secret Lord Krishna says.Srila Prabhupada called this verse as the essence of Bhagavad Gita also. We SHOULD do these two things to go Back to Godhead.</p>
    <p>The verse is as follows:</p>
    <div id="verse">
        <p>
            Janma karma ca me divyam<br>evam yo vetti tattvatah<br>tyakva deham punar janma<br>naiti mam eti so'arjuna
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>Translation: One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna. </p>
    <p>So, from this verse, we can understand that knowing and the Lord's birth and activities can take us back to the Lord</p>

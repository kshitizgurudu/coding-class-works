    <h1>(Glorification of Srila Prabhupada By Kshitiz Gurudu)</h1>
    <h3>Dearest Srila Prabhupada,</h3>
    <p>I offer my respectful obeisance unto you. You are the Acarya who established ISKCON, International Society for Krishna Consciousness. All Glories unto you!!</p>
    <p>You are our eternal spritual master for all of us. You have given a easy way to understand who is Krishna, it's just the fault of the people who do not accept it. You clearly said that such activities lead people to Yamaloka, where they get fierce
        and deadly punishnents. You very clearly mentioned in S.B. 3.30.19-34, of the punishments in Yamaloka.</p>
    <p>Without you, our lives would be wasted in material entanglement. We are serving the Lord because of you, and we are in the mission of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
    <p>Because of you we are trying to use this life in the service of Lord Krishna. You are really a great leader and preacher. We are fortunate to be a part of your family (ISKCON).</p>
    <p>You wrote many books like the Shrimad Bhagavatam, Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, and many other books for our understanding. You established 108 temples all over the world.</p>
    <p>Without you our lives would have been wasted in Maya. You gave us this Krishna Bhakti, and helped us in the way of transcendental happiness.</p>
    <p>On this day of Vyasa Puja, I would like to thank you a billion, billion times to show the correct direction to this impure, insignificant soul.</p>
    <p>A fallen servant of yours,<br> Praying for your mercy,<br> Kshitiz Gurudu</p>

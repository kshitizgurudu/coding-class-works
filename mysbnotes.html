        <h3>Verse 1</h3>
        <ul>

            <li> Out of innumerable names of the lord, Krsna is the principle one. Krsna is the cause of all causes.</li>
            <li> Author of Srimad Bhagavatam is Vyasadeva, he authored it as per instruction of Narada Muni. The first created being was Brahma, down to the living entities.</li>
            <li>Vyasadeva worships Krsna, who’s transcendental pastimes are described in 10th canto. Vyasadeva gives a change to the readers to attain spiritual realization. Therefore, he invokes Gayatri Mantra. This is meant for spiritual advanced people.
            </li>
            <li>The Lord has 2 potencies. Internal and external.</li>
            <li>The internal potency is real, while the external potency is illusionary and temporary. The Lord knows everything directly and indirectly.</li>
            <li> The Lord is fully independent. Nothing or anyone is equal to the Supreme Lord or above him.</li>

            <li>When one comes to know his position as a servant, he is liberated from all miseries.</li>
            <li>The proper method to receive this message of Krsna is to hear it submissively. One must be anxious to hear the transcendental message.</li>

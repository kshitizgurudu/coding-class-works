    <p>Following is my personal notes prepared by myself based on my understanding of the translation and purport given by Srila Prabhupada. I suggest readers to visit authorized source Bhaktivedanta Vedabase at <a href="https://kshitizgurudu.in/congo.html">About Congo</a>        for detailed study on Srimad Bhagavatam by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda.

    <h2>Canto – 1, Creation, Chapter – 1, Questions by Sages</h2>
    <p>Verse 1 • Krishna is the son of Devaki and Vasudeva. Here Vyasa dev says Krsna is the original Supreme Personality of God head. ‘Krsna means all attractive” • Out of innumerable names of the lord, Krsna is the principle one. Krsna is the cause of
        all causes. • Author of Srimad Bhagavatam is Vyasadeva, he authored it as per instruction of Narada Muni. • The first created being was Brahma, down to the living entities. • Vyasadeva worships Krsna, who’s transcendental pastimes are described
        in 10th canto. • Vyasadeva gives a change to the readers to attain spiritual realization. Therefore, he invokes Gayatri Mantra. This is meant for spiritual advanced people. • The Lord has 2 potencies. Internal and external • The internal potency
        is real, while the external potency is illusionary an temporary. • The lord knows everything directly and indirectly. • The Lord is fully independent. Nothing or anyone is equal to the Supreme Lord or above him. All living beings are parts and
        parcels of the lord. • Unless one does not surrender to the lord, bewilderment is certain.

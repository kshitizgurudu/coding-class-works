    <h1>About Srila Prabhupada</h1>
    <p>His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada was born in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He met his spritual master, Srila Bhakti Sidhanta Saraswati Thakur, in Calcutta 1992, who instructed him to propagate Krishna Consiousness. He was initiated
        in 1933. In the years that followed, Srila Prabhupada wrote to his spritual master for rendering any service. Saraswati Thakur replied the same instruction Srila Prabhupada had recived in 1922. "Spread Krishna consciousness". In 1994, Srila Prabhupada
        started The Back To Godhead, an english mazagine. He single-handedly edited, typed, checked the galley proofs, and distributed copies of it.</p>

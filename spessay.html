    <h3>Dearest Srila Prabhupada,</h3>	
    <p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto you. You are the acarya who established ISKCON. All glories Unto you.</p>
    <p>You are our eternal well wisher. You have given a easy way to understand who is Krishna, his pastimes, etc. Without you our lives would have been wasted in material entanglement. We are serving the lotues feet of the Lord because of you, and we are in the mission of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
    <p>Because of you, we are trying to utilize this life in the service of Krishna. You are really a great leader and preacher. We are really fortunate to be a part of your family.</p>
    <p>You wrote many books like Bhagavad Gita, Shrimad Bhagavatam, and many books for our understanding. You established 108 temples all over the world.</p>
    <p>Without you lives would have been wasted in material opulence. You gave us this Krishna Bhakti, and helped us in the way of trenscendental happiness.</p>
    <p>On this day of Vyasa Puja, I would like to thank you a million, million times to give the right direction to the impure, insignificant soul.</p>
    <p>A fallen servant of yours,<br>
    Praying for your mercy,<br>
    Kshitiz Gurudu</p>
